# About the project

A simple recipe website project from [theodinproject](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) foundation path written only using HTML (CSS might be added later).

This project is basically just to showcase what I have learned so far and implement it in a presentable way.

All recipes are inspired by Vikings taken from this [blog](https://www.vikingwarriorshirts.com/blogs/news/10-delicious-authentic-viking-recipes).
